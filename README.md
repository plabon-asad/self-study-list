### iOS build process
Requirements:
 - [Apple Developers Account](https://developer.apple.com/)
 - [App Store connect Account](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login)
 - Xcode installed on your Mac, [Available List](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
 - [Ionic application](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios)
 - [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios#adding-the-ios-platform)

ToDo: Respective List of Work
 - Make apple developer account
 - Device Registration(iPhone)
 - Using Keychain Access [Keychain Access › Certificate Assistant › Request Certificate From a Certificate Authority]
 - Certificate Signing Request (CSR) <br>N.B. Make sure Not use ***Using OpenSSL* only use `Key Chain Access` procedure
 - Upload it on App store -[Certificate, Identifiers & Profile -> Profile(Its a tab)]
 - Download it and make a backup on secured place and then install it by double click.
 - Convert the certificate from a `.cer `file to a `.p12` file using KeyChain Access [Doc link...](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/package/credentials)
 - Go to appstore connect and login there, [URL](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login)
 - For upload apps need to make another profile(distribution) certificate in "App store connect"
 - Goto `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles` click + icon, 
 -  - select the "Apple Distribution option" and click on continue
 -  - Now it will ask for “Certificate Signing Request” which we have to create using Mac.
 -  - After everything done, download it and make it backup
 -  - Now try to build iOS with "Archive" and Upload it on App store [Help link](https://enappd.com/blog/releasing-ionic-app-on-ios-app-store/199/)
